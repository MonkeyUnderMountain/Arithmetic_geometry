\section{Hilbert's irreducibility theorem}

    The main reference for this section is \cite{Serre08galois}, which is an excellent book focusing on the inverse Galois problem.

    \begin{theorem}[Hilbert's irreducibility theorem]\label{thm:hilberts_irreducibility_theorem}
        Let \(f(x, t) \in \bbQ[x, t]\) be an irreducible polynomial in two variables with rational coefficients.
        Then there exist infinitely many rational numbers \(t_0 \in \bbQ\) such that the specialized polynomial \(f(x, t_0) \in \bbQ[x]\) is irreducible over \(\bbQ\).
        \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{theorem}

\subsection{Application to inverse Galois problem}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:inverse_Galois_problem_for_S_n}
        There exist infinitely many Galois extensions of \(\bbQ\) whose Galois group is isomorphic to the symmetric group \(S_n\) for each integer \(n \geq 1\).
    \end{theorem}
